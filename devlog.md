# Dev log

## June 25 2025

### Problems
- Need to implement interface or class to store chain off mem. Store inram cause serious scaling problems
- Think a new name `MMB` was kinda cringe
- My test fail

### Solution
- [x] Add devlog
- [x] Use `FileStorage` as a hecking chain object
- [] Change all the reference of `self.chain` to new chain wrapper
- [x] Renamed brand to `VSTD` (Vietnam Stable Digital)
- [x] Update new test logic (The problems is now the gas-free transaction appear and broke the test)
