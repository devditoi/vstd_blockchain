# Dev log

## June 25 2025

### Problems
- Need to implement interface or class to store chain off mem. Store inram cause serious scaling problems
- Think a new name MMB was kinda cringe

### Solution
- [x] Add devlog
- [x] Use FileStorage as a hecking chain object
- [] Change all the reference of self.chain to new chain wrapper
- [x] Renamed brand to VSTD (Vietnam Stable Digital)
