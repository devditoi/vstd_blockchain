# 1. Core Architecture Components
    L1 Layer (Existing + Modifications)
    L1 Node: Existing PoA nodes that will serve as the settlement layer
    Bridge Contract: Smart contract on L1 to manage L1↔L2 asset transfers
    State Commitment Contract: Stores L2 state roots and batch proofs
    L2 Layer (New)
    L2 Node: Handles transaction processing and block production
    L2 Chain: Manages L2's blockchain state and transaction ordering
    Consensus Engine: Handles L2's consensus (PoW/PoS hybrid)
    Batch Processor: Aggregates transactions for L1 submission
    State Manager: Manages L2's world state
# 2. Key Integration Points
    L1-L2 Communication
    Deposits (L1→L2): Users lock funds in L1 bridge contract, L2 mints equivalent tokens
    Withdrawals (L2→L1): Users initiate withdrawal on L2, wait for challenge period, then claim on L1
    State Commitments: L2 validators submit periodic state roots to L1
    Data Flow
    Users submit transactions to L2 nodes
    L2 nodes process transactions and update local state
    At epoch end, validators create batch with:
    Compressed transaction data
    New state root
    Validity proof
# 3. Refactoring Approach
    Phase 1: Core L2 Infrastructure
    New Packages:
    l2/chain: L2 blockchain implementation
    l2/consensus: L2 consensus mechanisms
    bridge: L1-L2 bridge contracts and clients
    state: L2 state management
    Modify Existing:
    Extend Node class to support L2 mode
    Add L2 RPC endpoints
    Update P2P layer for L2 message propagation
    Phase 2: Bridge Implementation
    L1 Contracts:
    Bridge contract for deposits/withdrawals
    State commitment contract
    Challenge mechanism for fraud proofs
    L2 Components:
    Bridge client to monitor L1 events
    Deposit/withdrawal queues
    State root submission logic
    Phase 3: Integration & Optimization
    Performance:
    Batch processing
    State pruning
    Parallel transaction execution
    Security:
    Challenge period enforcement
    Slashing conditions
    Validator set management
# 4. Key Design Decisions
    State Management
    Option 1: Full state` storage on L2, only commitments on L1
    Option 2: Hybrid approach with frequent state snapshots to L1
    Data Availability
    Option A: Store full transaction data on L1 (higher cost, better security)
    Option B: Store only state diffs on L1 (lower cost, more complex)
    Validator Selection
    Static Set: Pre-defined validators
    Dynamic: Staking-based selection
    Hybrid: Core validat`ors + rotating set
